# web4

## TL;DR

* Manage website frontend in smart contract
* Every `.near` account receives a subdomain under [https://near.page](https://near.page).
    * E.g. `thewiki.near` serves [https://thewiki.near.page](https://thewiki.near.page).
* Use IPFS with Filecoin to host larger files

## What is web4?

- Decentralised ownership and hosting
- Content permanence by default, no more expired links
- Offline friendly
- Web presence controlled by user
- Interactive mobile apps linked together as websites, no appstores

## How it works?

You only need to deploy single smart contract using WebAssembly to host your app HTTP backend,
static resources and blockchain logic.

There is an [HTTP gateway](https://github.com/vgrichina/web4) to NEAR blockchain which allows smart contract to handle arbitrary GET requests.

Every smart contract on NEAR also gets corresponding API endpoint which can be accessed through regular HTTP requests.

### Authentication

Web4 provides simplified authentication flow:

- Login via `/web4/login` endpoint
- Logout via `/web4/logout` endpoint 
- Current account ID is available via `web4_account_id` cookie
- Transactions can be submitted via POST requests to `/web4/contract/{contract_id}/{method_name}`

Example usage in JavaScript:

```javascript
// Login
window.location.href = '/web4/login'

// Check if user is logged in
const accountId = Cookies.get('web4_account_id');

// Logout
window.location.href = '/web4/logout'

// Submit transaction
await fetch('/web4/contract/example.near/someMethod', {
    method: 'POST',
    body: JSON.stringify({ param1: 'value1' })
})
```

This allows seamless integration with existing web frameworks while maintaining security through NEAR wallet.

## Example contract (in AssemblyScript)

```ts
export function web4_get(request: Web4Request): Web4Response {
    if (request.path == '/test') {
        // Render HTML with form to submit a message
        return htmlResponse(form({ action: "/web4/contract/guest-book.testnet/addMessage" }, [
            textarea({ name: "text" }),
            button({ name: "submit" }, ["Post"])
        ]));
    }


    if (request.path == '/messages') {
        const getMessagesUrl = '/web4/contract/guest-book.testnet/getMessages';
        // Request preload of dependency URLs
        if (!request.preloads) {
            return preloadUrls([getMessagesUrl]);
        }

        // Render HTML with messages
        return htmlResponse('messages: ' + util.bytesToString(request.preloads.get(getMessagesUrl).body)!);
    }

    if (request.accountId) {
        // User is logged in, we can welcome them
        return htmlResponse('Hello to <b>' +  request.accountId! + '</b> from <code>' + request.path + '</code>');
    }

    // Demonstrate serving content from IPFS
    if (request.path == "/") {
        return bodyUrl('ipfs://bafybeib72whzo2qiore4q6sumdteh6akewakrvukvqmx4n6kk7nwzinpaa/')
    }

    // By default return 404 Not Found
    return status(404);
}

```

Basically smart contract just needs to implement `web4_get` method to take in and return data in specific format.

### Request

```ts
@nearBindgen
class Web4Request {
    accountId: string | null;
    path: string;
    params: Map<string, string>;
    query: Map<string, Array<string>>;
    preloads: Map<string, Web4Response>;
}
```

### Response

```ts
@nearBindgen
class Web4Response {
    contentType: string;
    status: u32;
    body: Uint8Array;
    bodyUrl: string;
    preloadUrls: string[] = [];
    cacheControl: string;
}
```

### Loading data

You can load any required data in `web4_get` by returning list of URLs to preload in `preloadUrls` field.

E.g. contract above preloads `/web4/contract/guest-book.testnet/getMessages`. This class `getMessages` view method on `guest-book.testnet` contract.

After data is preloaded `web4_get` gets called again with loaded data injected into `preloads`.

### Posting transactions

You can post transaction by making a POST request to corresponding URL.

E.g contract above preloads has form that gets posted to `/web4/contract/guest-book.testnet/addMessage` URL. This URL submits transaction which calls `addMessage` method on `guest-book.testnet` contract.

Note that both JSON and form data are supported. When transaction is processed by server user gets redirected to wallet for signing this transaction.

In future there is a plan to allow sending app-specific key as a cookie to sign limited subset of transactions without confirmation in wallet.

### Caching considerations

By default all HTML responses can be cached for 1 minute (assumed dynamic content). 
All images, videos, audio and CSS can be cached for 1 day (assumed static content).

You can override this by setting `cacheControl` field in response.

It's not recommended to cache content for too long as then it not going to be hot on IPFS gateway.

## Rust support

Check out [sample web4 project made with Rust](https://github.com/frol/near-web4-demo).

# near.page

You can access your deployed smart contract on https://near.page. This is hosted web4 gateway provided to all `.near` accounts. For now it's free, but in future you might have to pay depending on how much traffic you get.

Every contract gets corresponding domain, e.g. check out https://web4.near.page rendered by `web4.near` contract.

# testnet.page

This works same as `near.page` but for contracts deployed on testnet. Every `account.testnet` gets corresponding `account.testnet.page` domain.

# Running locally

1. Install [mkcert](https://mkcert.dev/).
2. Install local certificate authority (this allows browser to trust self-signed certificates):
    ```bash
    mkcert -install
    ```
3. Create `*.near.page` SSL certificate:
    ```bash
    mkcert "*.near.page"
    ```
3. Run `web4` man-in-the-middle proxy locally:
    ```bash
    IPFS_GATEWAY_URL=https://ipfs.near.social NODE_ENV=mainnet WEB4_KEY_FILE=./_wildcard.near.page-key.pem WEB4_CERT_FILE=./_wildcard.near.page.pem npx web4-near
    ```
4. Setup browser to use [automatic proxy configuration file](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Proxy_servers_and_tunneling/Proxy_Auto-Configuration_PAC_file) at `http://localhost:8080/` or to use `localhost:8080` as an HTTPS proxy server. 

## Environment variables

- `NODE_ENV` - `mainnet` or `testnet` to select network ID to use with NEAR config and key store
- `IPFS_GATEWAY_URL` - URL of IPFS gateway to use for `ipfs://` URLs
- `WEB4_KEY_FILE` - path to SSL key file
- `WEB4_CERT_FILE` - path to SSL certificate file
- `PORT` - port to listen on (default: `3000`)
- `PROXY_PORT` - port to listen on for proxy requests (default: `8080`). HTTPS MITM proxy is run on this port when `WEB4_KEY_FILE` and `WEB4_CERT_FILE` are provided.
- `FAST_NEAR_URL` - URL of [fast-near](https://github.com/vgrichina/fast-near) RPC server to use for NEAR API. Overrides NEAR RPC config selected by `NODE_ENV`.
